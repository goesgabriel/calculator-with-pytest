# Advanced Calculator Project

This project is a comprehensive calculator capable of performing a variety of mathematical operations. It includes functionalities beyond basic arithmetic operations, such as generating Fibonacci sequences, summing intervals, and more.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Reverse operations
- Interval sum calculation
- Fibonacci sequence generation
- Odd list generation
- Calculation history tracking

## File Descriptions

- `calc.py`: The main file that runs the calculator program. It includes the user interface and the main logic of the calculator.
- `calculator.py`: This file contains the Calculator class with basic arithmetic operations.
- `calculator_concat_sum.py`: This file extends the Calculator class and overrides the addition operation to perform string concatenation.
- `multi_func_calculator.py`: This file extends the Calculator class and adds additional methods for interval summing, Fibonacci sequence generation, and odd list generation.
- `reverse_calculator.py`: This file extends the Calculator class and reverses the operations.
- `test_mult_func_calculator.py` & `test_reverse_calculator.py`: These files contain the unit tests for the multi-function calculator and reverse calculator respectively.
- `type_value.py`: This file contains a function to determine the type of various inputs.
